# copium

patches to chromium allowing to build with gcc, libstdc++,
and some other common distro fixes (like unbundle scripts).

as of M124, chromium still cannot be built with both clang
and libstdc++. choose your poison. if it's the former,
you're in the right place.

some patches are cherry-picks from chromium main branch,
some sourced from gentoo.
