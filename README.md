patches to chromium, probably-commonly-needed distro fixes.

some patches are cherry-picks from chromium main branch,
some are made by me, lnl (most get upstreamed in the end).
i'm sharing them under the same BSD-3-Clause license as chromium,
with no additional restrictions.
there also used to be some patches from gentoo here, not anymore.

patches are prefixed by software and its version branch,
e.g. `cr124-` means chromium M124, and `e30-` means electron 30-x-y.
chromium might still require patches made for previous versions
without any changes - the number will not change in that case.
similarly, building electron 30 will require `cr124` patches as well.
